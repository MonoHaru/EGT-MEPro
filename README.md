## 💡 Abstract

##### Early detection and management of faults in a ship’s main engine are essential for ensuring both efficient and safe operation. Such faults can result in substantial economic losses and heightened safety risks. However, conventional fault diagnosis methods are inherently limited, as they can only address issues that have already occurred at the current time point. In this study, we extend fault diagnosis from the present to future time points by utilizing exhaust gas temperature data collected under actual operating conditions. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this approach for main engine fault diagnosis. The research proceeds in three stages. First, various machine learning models are applied to current-time fault diagnosis to determine the most suitable model. Second, a Transformer-based model is developed to predict future time-series data, and its performance is assessed. Finally, fault diagnosis at future time points is performed using the predicted time-series data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach, leveraging predicted time-series data, achieves a fault diagnosis accuracy of 78.160%.

**Note**
If you wish to perform fault diagnostics only at the current time point, you need to complete only the **First Step**. To predict time-series data for conducting fault diagnosis at a future time point, proceed with the **Second Step**. For fault prognostics at a future time point, carry out the **Last Step**, which includes both the **First Step** and the **Second Step**.
